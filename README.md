# Odin-Project-Landing-Page
Landing Page project for T.O.P

A few afterthoughts:

Before starting, just reading the project was intimidating. I had a grasp of how to structure the code, but this is the first time having to do an entire page with no guidance or pre-written template for the HTML or CSS portion. 

After completing it, what really stood out in terms of learning tools were the prior "flex exercise" modules, specifically #5, #6 and #7.

For whatever reason, for me, those three modules heavily emphasized the structure of the HTML/CSS code, how to order it, and what to look for when placing certain groups in it's own <div>.

What I've realized was that, it was only intimidating before typing that first line of code into HTML. Everything afterward just kept on rolling like a wave.
